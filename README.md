wpp-ZF-Core
===========

This is my Wordpress plugin that enables me to develop other wordpress plugins in the form of Zend 1.x Applications in MVC style. This plugin provides php model wrappers for WP Posts, Comments and Users. It also has appropriate Backbone js-Models and php-restful controllers aswell.

I also included here some famous useful stuff like:
jQueryUI, Twitter Bootstrap, backbone, underscore, jslesscss, h5bp and other things that might come in handy.

This is far away from being nicely documented and a lot to be refactored. Uniting WP and ZendFramework is like creating Frankenstein. 

I hope someday I'll make it public friendly.
